Based on a comparison of the IETF draft for the RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP) and the provided OpenAPI specification, several key differences in endpoint structure, HTTP method usage, and resource modeling are apparent. The OpenAPI specification appears to be a more detailed and potentially evolved implementation of the concepts outlined in the draft.

Here is a summary of the notable differences:

### Endpoint Structure and Naming

A primary difference lies in the URL structure for managing resource processes like renewals and transfers. The OpenAPI specification introduces a `/processes/` path segment that is not present in the draft.

* **RPP Draft:** Uses simpler, action-oriented paths directly under the resource ID (e.g., `/{collection}/{id}/renewal`).
* **OpenAPI Spec:** Nests these actions under a `/processes/` sub-resource (e.g., `/contacts/{id}/processes/transfer`, `/domains/{id}/processes/renewal`).

### HTTP Method and Endpoint Discrepancies

The two documents specify different HTTP methods and endpoint paths for several key operations.

| Feature                          | RPP IETF Draft (draft-wullink-rpp-core-01)       | OpenAPI Specification                                                                                                            | Summary of Difference                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Check for Existence**    | `HEAD /{collection}/{id}`                      | Not explicitly defined. Existence is checked via `GET`, which returns a `404 Not Found`status if the resource doesn't exist. | The draft specifies using the `HEAD`method for efficient existence checks. The OpenAPI spec relies on the behavior of the `GET`method.                        |
| **Renew Resource**         | `POST /{collection}/{id}/renewal`              | `PUT /domains/{id}/processes/renewal`                                                                                          | The HTTP method (`POST`vs.`PUT`) and the URL structure are different.                                                                                         |
| **Update Resource**        | `PATCH /{collection}/{id}`                     | No `PATCH`endpoints are defined for resources like domains, contacts, or hosts.                                                | The OpenAPI specification completely omits the resource update functionality described in the draft.                                                              |
| **Transfer: Request**      | `POST /{collection}/{id}/transfer`             | `POST /{collection}/{id}/processes/transfer`                                                                                   | The path structure is different, with the OpenAPI spec using the `/processes/`segment.                                                                          |
| **Transfer: Query Status** | `GET /{collection}/{id}/transfer`              | `GET /{collection}/{id}/processes/transfer/latest`                                                                             | The OpenAPI spec adds `/latest`to the path to query the most recent transfer process.                                                                           |
| **Transfer: Cancel**       | `POST /{collection}/{id}/transfer/cancelation` | `DELETE /{collection}/{id}/processes/transfer/latest`                                                                          | The HTTP method (`POST`vs.`DELETE`) and the path are different. The OpenAPI usage of `DELETE`is arguably more aligned with REST principles for this action. |
| **Transfer: Reject**       | `POST /{collection}/{id}/transfer/rejection`   | `PUT /{collection}/{id}/processes/transfer/latest/rejection`                                                                   | The HTTP method (`POST`vs.`PUT`) and the path structure are different.                                                                                        |
| **Transfer: Approve**      | `POST /{collection}/{id}/transfer/approval`    | `PUT /{collection}/{id}/processes/transfer/latest/approval`                                                                    | The HTTP method (`POST`vs.`PUT`) and the path structure are different.                                                                                        |

### Header Naming and Usage

The naming convention for custom RPP headers varies slightly between the two documents.

* **RPP Draft:** Uses Pascal-Case for headers, such as `RPP-Cltrid`, `RPP-Svtrid`, and `RPP-Check-Avail`.
* **OpenAPI Spec:** Uses lowercase for headers, such as `rpp-cltrid` and `rpp-svtrid`.
* **Missing Header:** The `RPP-Check-Avail` header, which the draft requires for existence checks, is absent from the OpenAPI specification, corresponding to the missing `HEAD` endpoint.

### Consistent Operations

Several fundamental operations are consistent in their method and basic structure across both documents:

* **Create Resource:** `POST /{collection}`
* **Get Resource Information:** `GET /{collection}/{id}`
* **Delete Resource:** `DELETE /{collection}/{id}`
* **Poll for Messages:** `GET /messages`
* **Acknowledge (Delete) Message:** `DELETE /messages/{id}`
