1.  Introduction

   This document describes an Application Programming Interface (API)
   API based on the HTTP protocol [RFC2616] and the principles of
   [REST].  Conforming to the REST constraints is generally referred to
   as being "RESTful".  Hence the API is dubbed: "'RESTful Provisioning
   Protocol" or "RPP" for short.

Internet-Draft        RESTful Provisioning Protocol            July 2025


   RPP is data format agnostic, this document describes a framework
   describing protocol messages in any data format. the client uses
   server-driven content negotiation.  Allowing the client to select
   from a set of representation media types supported by the server,
   such as JSON [RFC8259], XML or [YAML].

2.  Terminology

   In this document the following terminology is used.

   REST - Representational State Transfer ([REST]).  An architectural
   style.

   RESTful - A RESTful web service is a web service or API implemented
   using HTTP and the principles of [REST].

   EPP RFCs - This is a reference to the EPP version 1.0 specifications
   [RFC5730], [RFC5731], [RFC5732] and [RFC5733].

   RESTful Provisioning Protocol or RPP - The protocol described in this
   document.

   URL - A Uniform Resource Locator as defined in [RFC3986].

   Resource - An object having a type, data, and possible relationship
   to other resources, identified by a URL.

   RPP client - An HTTP user agent performing an RPP request

   RPP server - An HTTP server responsible for processing requests and
   returning results in any supported media type.

3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In examples, lines starting with "C:" represent data sent by a RPP
   client and lines starting with "S:" represent data returned by a RPP
   server.  Indentation and white space in examples are provided only to
   illustrate element relationships and are not REQUIRED features of the
   protocol.

   All example requests assume a RPP server using HTTP version 2 is
   listening on the standard HTTPS port on host rppp.example.nl.  An
   authorization token has been provided by an out of band process and
   MUST be used by the client to authenticate each request.

4.  Request Headers

   A RPP request does not always require a request message body.  The
   information conveyed by the HTTP method, URL, and request headers may
   be sufficient for the server to be able to successfully processes a
   request.  However, the client MUST include a request message body
   when the server requires additional attributes to be present in the
   request message.  The RPP HTTP headers listed below use the "RPP-"
   prefix, following the recommendations in [RFC6648].

   -  RPP-Cltrid: The client transaction identifier is the equivalent of
      the clTRID element defined in [RFC5730] and MUST be used
      accordingly, when the HTTP message body does not contain an EPP
      request that includes a cltrid.

   -  RPP-Authorization: The client MAY use this header to send
      authorization information in the format <method> <authorization
      information>, similar to the HTTP Authorization header.  The
      <method> indicates the type of authorization being used.  The
      authorization information MUST be defined as a structured field
      (dictionary) as described in [RFC8941].  For the EPP Authorization
      Information using plain password the following method is defined
      and MUST be used: <method> = AuthInfo The <authorization
      information> for AuthInfo method defines the following fields:

      -  AuthInfo (REQUIRED): base64 encoded EPP authorization
         information.  Base64 encoding is used to prevent potential
         problems when non-ascii characters or other characters are
         present that may conflict with the format rules for structured
         field.
      -  Roid (OPTIONAL): A Roid as defined in [RFC5731], [RFC5733], and
         [RFC5730].  This field MAY be REQUIRED in the usage context as
         defined in [RFC5731], [RFC5733], and [RFC5730].

   -  RPP-Authorization: The client MAY use this header to send
      authorization information in the format <method> <authorization
      information>, similar to the HTTP Authorization header.  The
      <method> indicates the type of authorization being used.  The
      authorization information MUST be defined as a structured field
      (dictionary) as described in [RFC8941].  For the EPP AuthInfo
      method this format MUST be used: AuthInfo=<Base64(AuthInfo)>;
      Roid=<Roid>, where AuthInfo is REQUIRED and MUST be encoded using
      base64, to prevent potential problems when non-ascii characters or
      other characters are present that may conflict with the format
      rules for structured field.  The Roid is OPTIONAL unless required
      by the context (as described in [RFC5731], [RFC5733], and
      [RFC5730]).  For other methods, the authorization information
      format is method-specific and may not use key/value pairs unless
      otherwise specified.

5.  Response Headers

   The server HTTP response contains a status code, headers, and MAY
   contain an RPP response message in the message body.  HTTP headers
   are used to transmit additional data to the client and MAY be used to
   send RPP process related data to the client.  HTTP headers used by
   RPP MUST use the "RPP-" prefix, the following response headers have
   been defined for RPP.

   -  RPP-Svtrid: This header is the equivalent of the "svTRID" element
      defined in [RFC5730] and MUST be used accordingly when the RPP
      response does not contain an EPP response in the HTTP message
      body.  If an HTTP message body with the EPP XML equivalent
      "svTRID" exists, both values MUST be consistent.

   -  RPP-Cltrid: This header is the equivalent of the "clTRID" element
      defined in [RFC5730] and MUST be used accordingly when the RPP
      response does not contain an EPP response in the HTTP message
      body.  If the contents of the HTTP message body contains a
      "clTRID" value, then both values MUST be consistent.

   -  RPP-Code: This header is the equivalent of the EPP result code
      defined in [RFC5730] and MUST be used accordingly.  This header
      MUST be added to all responses and MAY be used by the client for
      easy access to the result code, without having to parse the HTTP
      response message body.

   For the EPP codes related to session management (1500, 2500, 2501 and
   2502) there are no corresponding RPP codes.

   In order for RPP to be backwards compatible with EPP, RPP will use
   5-digit coding of the result codes, where first digit will denote
   origin specification of the result codes.

   For [RFC5730] Result Codes the leading digit MUST be "0".  For RPP
   result codes the leading digit MUST be "1".  For avoidance of
   confusion RPP MUST not define new codes with the same semantic
   meaning as already defined in EPP.

   For RPP codes the remaining 4 digits MUST keep the same semantics as
   [RFC5730] Result Codes.

   -  RPP-Queue-Size: Return the number of unacknowledged messages in
      the client message queue.  The server MAY include this header in
      all RPP responses.

6.  Error handling and relation between HTTP status codes and RPP codes

   RPP leverages standard HTTP status codes to reflect the outcome of
   RPP operations.  The RPP result codes are based on the EPP result
   codes defined in [RFC5730].  This allows clients to handle responses
   generically using common HTTP patterns.  While the HTTP status code
   provides the primary, high-level outcome, the specific RPP result
   code MUST still be provided in the RPP-Code HTTP header for detailed
   diagnostics.

   The mapping strategy is to use the most specific HTTP code that
   accurately reflects the operation's result.

   For common and well-defined outcomes, a specific HTTP status code is
   used.  For example, an attempt to access a non-existent resource (EPP
   code 2302) MUST return 404 Not Found, and an attempt to create a
   resource that already exists (EPP code 2303) MUST return 409
   Conflict.  This allows a client to handle these common situations
   based on the HTTP code alone.

   For all other failures, a generic HTTP status code is used.  Client-
   side errors (e.g., syntax, parameter, or policy violations) MUST
   return 400 Bad Request.  Server-side failures MUST return 500
   Internal Server Error.

   The server MUST return HTTP status codes, following the mapping rules
   in Table 1.

                                  Table 1

   Some EPP result codes, like 01500, 02500, 02501 and 02502 are related
   to session management and therefore not applicable to a sessionless
   RPP protocol.

7.  Endpoints

   subsequent sections provide details for each endpoint.  URLs are
   assumed to be using the prefix: "/{context-root}/{version}/".  Some
   RPP endpoints do not require a request and/or response message.

   {c}: An abbreviation for {collection}: this MUST be substituted with
   "domains", "hosts", "entities" or any other collection of objects.
   {i}: An abbreviation for an object id, this MUST be substituted with
   the value of a domain name, hostname, contact-id or a message-id or
   any other defined object.

   A RPP client MAY use the HTTP GET method for executing informational
   request only when no request data has to be added to the HTTP message
   body.  Sending content using an HTTP GET request is discouraged in
   [RFC9110], there exists no generally defined semantics for content
   received in a GET request.  When an RPP object requires additional
   information, the client MUST use the HTTP POST method and add the
   query command content to the HTTP message body.

7.1.  Availability for Creation

   The Availability for Creation endpoint is used to check whether an
   object can be successfully provisioned.  Two distinct methods are
   defined for checking the availability of provisioning of an object,
   the first method uses the HEAD method for a quick check to find out
   if the object can be provisioned.  The second method uses the GET
   method to retrieve additional information about the object's
   availability for provisioning, for example about pricing or
   additional requirements to be able to provision the requested object.

   When the client uses the HTTP HEAD method, the server MUST respond
   with an HTTP status code 200 (OK) if the object can be provisioned or
   with an HTTP status code 404 (Not Found) if the object cannot be
   provisioned.

   When the client uses the HTTP GET method, the server MUST respond
   with an HTTP status code 200 (OK) if the object can be provisioned.
   The server MUST include a message body containing more detailed
   availability information, for example about pricing or additional
   requirements to be able to provision the requested object.  The
   message body MAY be and empty JSON object if no additional
   information is applicable.

   If the object cannot be provisioned then the server MUST return an
   HTTP status code 404 (Not Found) and include a problem statement in
   the message body.

   As an extension point the server MAY define and the client MAY use
   additional HTTP query parameters to further specify the check
   operation or the kind of response information that shall be returned.
   For example Registry Fee Extension [RFC8748] defines a possibility to
   request certain currency, only certain commands or periods.  Such
   functionality would add query parameters, which could be used with
   GET request to receive additional pricing information with the
   response.  HEAD request would not be affected in this case.

   The server MUST respond with the same HTTP status code if the same
   URL is requested with HEAD and with GET.

   - Request: HEAD|GET /{collection}/{id}/availability
   - Request message: None
   - Response message: Optional availability response

   Example request for a domain name that is not available for
   provisioning:

7.2.  Resource Information

   The Object Info request MUST use the HTTP GET method on a resource
   identifying an object instance.  If the object has authorization
   information attached then the client MUST use an empty message body
   and include the RPP-AuthInfo HTTP header.  If the authorization is
   linked to a database object the client MUST also include the RPP-Roid
   header.  The client MAY also use a message body that includes the
   authorization information, the client MUST then not use the RPP-
   AuthInfo and RPP-Roid headers.

   -  Request: GET /{collection}/{id}
   -  Request message: Optional
   -  Response message: Info response

   Example request for an object not using authorization information.

   GET /rpp/v1/domains/example.nl HTTP/2
   Host: rpp.example.nl
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   Accept: application/rpp+json
   Accept-Language: en

7.3.  Poll for Messages

   The messages endpoint is used for retrieving messages stored on the
   server for the client to process.

   -  Request: GET /messages
   -  Request message: None
   -  Response message: Poll response

   The client MUST use the HTTP GET method on the messages resource
   collection to request the message at the head of the queue.

   Example request:

   GET /rpp/v1/messages HTTP/2
   Host: rpp.example.nl

7.4.  Delete Message

   -  Request: DELETE /messages/{id}
   -  Request message: None
   -  Response message: Poll Ack response

   The client MUST use the HTTP DELETE method to acknowledge receipt of
   a message from the queue.  The "msgID" attribute of a received RPP
   Poll message MUST be included in the message resource URL, using the
   {id} path element.  The server MUST use RPP headers to return the RPP
   result code and the number of messages left in the queue.  The server
   MUST NOT add content to the HTTP message body of a successful
   response, the server may add content to the message body of an error
   response.

   Example request:

7.5.  Create Resource

   -  Request: POST /{collection}
   -  Request message: Object Create request
   -  Response message: Object Create response

   The client MUST use the HTTP POST method to create a new object
   resource.  If the RPP request results in a newly created object, then
   the server MUST return HTTP status code 200 (OK).  The server MUST
   add the "Location" header to the response, the value of this header
   MUST be the URL for the newly created resource.

7.8.  Transfer Resource

   The Transfer command is mapped to a nested resource, named
   "transfer".  The semantics of the HTTP DELETE method are determined
   by the role of the client executing the DELETE method.  The DELETE
   method is defined as "reject transfer" for the current sponsoring
   client of the object.  For the new sponsoring client the DELETE
   method is defined as "cancel transfer".

7.8.1.  Start

   -  Request: POST /{collection}/{id}/transfer
   -  Request message: Optional
   -  Response message: Status

   In order to initiate a new object transfer process, the client MUST
   use the HTTP POST method on a unique resource to create a new
   transfer resource object.  Not all RPP objects support the Transfer
   command.

   If the transfer request is successful, then the response MUST include
   the Location header for the object being transferred.

11.  Security Considerations

   RPP relies on the security of the underlying HTTP [RFC9110]
   transport, hence the best common practices for securing HTTP also
   apply to RPP.  It is RECOMMENDED to follow them closely.

   Data confidentiality and integrity MUST be enforced, all data
   transport between a client and server MUST be encrypted using TLS
   [RFC5246].  Section 9 describes the level of security that is
   REQUIRED for all RPP endpoints.

   Due to the stateless nature of RPP, the client MUST include the
   authentication credentials in each HTTP request.  This MAY be done by
   using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) [RFC7519] or Basic authentication
   [RFC7617].

12.  Change History

12.1.  Version 01 to 02

   -  Merged the RPP-EPP-Code and RPP-Code headers into a single RPP-
      Code header

12.2.  Version 00 to 01

   -  Updated "Request Headers" and "Response Headers" section
   -  Changed transfer resource URL and HTTP method for reject, approve
      and cancel, in order to make the API easier to use

12.3.  Version 00 (draft-rpp-core) to 00 (draft-wullink-rpp-core)

   -  Renamed the document name to "draft-wullink-rpp-core"
   -  Removed sections: Design Considerations, Resource Naming
      Convention, Session Management, HTTP Layer, Content Negotiation,
      Object Filtering, Error Handling
   -  Renamed Commands section to Endpoints
